Streaming Practice Problems:
Basic Streaming:

Problem: Create a streaming function that outputs a step-by-step explanation of how to solve a math problem (e.g., "What is 72 divided by 8?"). The function should stream the steps and the final result to the user.

Task:

Use the Runner.run_streamed() method to stream the output.

Break down the division into steps and stream each step.

Output the final result of the division at the end.

Tool Streaming:

Problem: Use streaming to display the progress of a weather API tool. As the weather data is fetched (e.g., from a mock API), stream each part of the weather information (like temperature, humidity, and wind speed) as it becomes available.

Task:

Stream the results as they come in, for example, "Temperature: 25Â°C", "Humidity: 80%", etc., and then output the full weather data once all the information is available.

Real-Time Text Generation:

Problem: Build a function that streams a joke line-by-line. For example, if the joke is "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts," stream each line as the punchline is revealed.

Task:

Stream the joke in parts, and show the punchline in the last line after streaming the setup.

Multiple Step Process:

Problem: Stream the results of a multi-step calculation (e.g., solving the quadratic equation). As each intermediate step is calculated, stream the result (like calculating the discriminant, then finding the roots).

Task:

Show the intermediate results before finally revealing the solution to the user.
